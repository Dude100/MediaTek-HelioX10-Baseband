 * FUNCTION
 *  FS_Open
 * DESCRIPTION
 *  FS_Open opens and possibly creates a file for subsequent read and/or write access.
 * PARAMETERS
 *  FileName  : [IN]<P>Must point to the name of the file to open/create.
 *                    File names are not case sensitive; they will be converted to
 *                    upper case when file system searches this file, and they should
 *                    be two-byte aligned and UCS2 encoded. The file name can have one
 *                    of the following formats:
 *                    [Drive:][\][Path\]Name[.Ext]  A data file or directory file name with optional drive and path information.

 *  The generated virtual filename is a wide-character type, null-terminated string.

 *  This function provides facility for user to check a file. It will check
 *  if this exists or not first and then check the cluster chain. If
 *  invalid cluster is allocated (for an example, 0), error code,
 *  FS_CHECKDISK_RETRY (-41), will be returned. Finally, it will check if
 *  the file size fit the allocation size. If not, the file size will be

 * PARAMETERS

 * RETURNS
 *  If the function succeeds, the return value is FS_NO_ERROR. If the function fails, the return value is a negative error code. If FS_CHECKDISK_RETRY (-41) is returned, it means the file has allocated an invalid cluster. You should ask for check the whole drive to fix this error.

 *  Progress    : [IN]<P>   The callback function. Please refer to FS_FormatCallback.
 * RETURN VALUES
 *  12, 16 or 32: If format is successful, a positive integer will be returned. 12/16/32 means the target drive is formatted as FAT12/FAT16/FAT32.
 *  FS_PARAM_ERROR (-2): Use special format level not defined here
 *  FS_UNSUPPORTED_DRIVER_FUNCTION (-12): Call low-level format on removable device
 *  FS_MEDIA_CHANGED (-26): Try to format the removable device, which is not present
 *  FS_DEVICE_BUSY (-46): Only removable device, e.g., memory card, may return this error code. When file system is counting free space on devices in FS_LockFAT or FS_TestMSDC, this error code will be returned.
 *  FS_DEVICE_EXPORTED_ERROR (-52): Try to format an exporting drive. In this case, file handles will not be closed.
 * NOTE
 *  (1) High-level format will just clean up the FAT table of this drive while low-level format will scan the whole disk, re-partition the whole disk and re-build the driver structure. » Even if you just low level format a drive, the whole disk will be low-level formatted.
 *  (2) Other restriction is that only NOR and NAND flash provide the low-level format function. In most cases, you should call high-level format for cleaning up drive purpose. But if you have ever received ¡§FS_SYSTEM_CRASH¡¨ error code when accessing that drive (NAND flash only), you should call low-level format to make NAND flash driver re-construct the whole system again.
 *  (3) Format may take a long time. Task should provide callback function for File System to report the format status.
 *  (4) Format function will close all the file handles on this disk automatically.
 *  (5) Low-level format may cost a lot of memory, please be careful of your task stack size.

 * NOTE
