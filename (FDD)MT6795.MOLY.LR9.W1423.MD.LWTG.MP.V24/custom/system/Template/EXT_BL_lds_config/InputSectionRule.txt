                            [Rule]
Functions(ROCODE) or Variables(ROData, RW, ZI) can only be wrapped 
in the following input section name with specific conditions:

<EXT_READ_ONLY_TAIL>
For ROCODE/RODATA which does not have any special requirement

<EXT_READ_WRITE>
      For RW which does not have any special requirement

<EXT_READ_WRITE_ZI>
      For ZI which does not have any special requirement

<EXT_READ_ONLY_INT>
      For ROCODE/RODATA to be put in ITCM or internal RAM

<EXT_READ_WRITE_INT>
      For RW to be put in DTCM or internal RAM

<EXT_READ_WRITE_INT_ZI>
      For ZI to be put in DTCM or internal RAM

<EX_UI_NIT>
      For variables that will be directly initialized by user, or whose content does not need to be initialized, It will be put in external RAM

For any other requirements, please contact with linker script manager directly.


                        [How to modify?]

1. To move a function-ABC into a specific region by XXX, you can use: 
__attribute__ ((section ("XXX"))) 
void ABC() { ... }

e.g. For moving the function ABC into EXT_READ_ONLY_INT, you can write as below:
__attribute__ ((section ("EXT_READ_ONLY_INT"))) 
void ABC() { ... }


2. To move a RW variable ABC into a specific region by XXX, you can use: 
__attribute__ ((section ("XXX"))) 
int ABC = 10;

e.g. For moving the RW variable ABC into EXT_READ_WRITE region, you can write as below:
__attribute__ ((section ("EXT_READ_WRITE"))) 
int ABC = 10;


3. To move a ZI variable ABC into a specific region by XXX, you can use: 
__attribute__ ((section ("XXX"))) 
int ABC;

e.g. For moving the ZI variable ABC into EX_UINIT region, you can write as below:
__attribute__ ((section ("EX_UINIT")))
int ABC;

                            [FAQ]

1. How to designate a symbol into specific region(e.g. EX_UINIT) 
   in Bootloader but not in MAUI?
=> Use #if defined(__MINI_BOOTLOADER__) to wrap the symbol.
   e.g.
#if defined(__MINI_BOOTLOADER__)
__attribute__ ((section ("EX_UINIT")))
#endif
int ABC = 10;

2. How to designate a symbol into specific region(e.g. EX_UINIT) 
   in Ext_Bootloader but not in MAUI?
=> Use #if defined(__EXT_BOOTLOADER__) to wrap the symbol.
   e.g.
#if defined(__EXT_BOOTLOADER__)
__attribute__ ((section ("EX_UINIT")))
#endif
int ABC = 10;

3. How to designate a symbol into specific region(e.g. NONCACHEDRW)
   in MAUI but not in Bootloader or Ext_Bootloader?
=> Use #if !defined(__UBL__) to wrap the symbol.
   e.g.
#if defined(__MTK_TARGET__) && !defined(__UBL__)
__attribute__ ((section ("NONCACHEDRW")))
#endif
int ABC = 10;
