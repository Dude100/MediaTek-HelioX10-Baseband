                        [How to modify?]

1. To move a function ABC into a specific region by XXX, you can use: 
__attribute__ ((section ("XXX"))) 
void ABC() { ... }

e.g. For moving the function ABC into TCM, you can write as below:
__attribute__ ((section ("INTSRAM_ROCODE"))) 
void ABC() { ... }


2. To move a RW variable ABC into a specific region by XXX, you can use: 
__attribute__ ((section ("XXX"))) 
int ABC = 10;

e.g. For moving the RW variable ABC into NONCACHEABLE region, you can write as below:
__attribute__ ((section ("NONCACHEDRW"))) 
int ABC = 10;


3. To move a ZI variable ABC into a specific region by XXX, you can use: 
__attribute__ ((section ("XXX"))) 
int ABC;

e.g. For moving the ZI variable ABC into CACHEABLE region, you can write as below:
just not to add anything in front of your variable:
int ABC;

                            [FAQ]

1. How to designate a symbol into specific region(e.g. EX_UINIT) 
   in Bootloader but not in MAUI?
=> Use #if defined(__MINI_BOOTLOADER__) to wrap the symbol.
   e.g.
#if defined(__MINI_BOOTLOADER__)
__attribute__ ((section ("EX_UINIT")))
#endif
int ABC = 10;

2. How to designate a symbol into specific region(e.g. EX_UINIT) 
   in Ext_Bootloader but not in MAUI?
=> Use #if defined(__EXT_BOOTLOADER__) to wrap the symbol.
   e.g.
#if defined(__EXT_BOOTLOADER__)
__attribute__ ((section ("EX_UINIT")))
#endif
int ABC = 10;

3. How to designate a symbol into specific region(e.g. NONCACHEDRW)
   in MAUI but not in Bootloader or Ext_Bootloader?
=> Use #if !defined(__UBL__) to wrap the symbol.
   e.g.
#if defined(__MTK_TARGET__) && !defined(__UBL__)
__attribute__ ((section ("NONCACHEDRW")))
#endif
int ABC = 10;
